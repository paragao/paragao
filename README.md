Name is Paulo Aragão. I love music and technology. All repositories are real code that I have at sometime developed based on a customer request. 

Hopefully those are good examples of specific technologies (React, AWS, NodeJS, Python) being used in a real world scenario. Some are very simple projects and others more complex. 

`I work at Amazon Web Services (AWS). All my opinions and code are my own and do not represent in any way the views of my employer. Code provided here follows the best practices whevener possible. Code provided here should not be used in production before careful analysis.`
